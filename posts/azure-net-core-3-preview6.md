# Publish ASP.NET Core 3 preview6 to Azure

I am currently writing a prototype web application for a client. I'm planning to use this prototype as a way to learn web development. Particularly, ASP.NET Core Web API, Angular, and Azure.
For now, let's talk about the .NET Core 3 and Azure. A little more than a week ago, Microsoft just released [.NET Core 3 preview 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0-preview-6/) so I've decided to use that. I'm going to describe what I did step by step and you can follow along. Let me know if you encounter any issues or have questions by creating a new issue in [this blog's github repository](https://github.com/gojanpaolo/gojanpaolo.github.io) or you can email me at [go.janpaolo@gmail.com](mailto:go.janpaolo@gmail.com). Also, let me know what areas we can improve on. Let's get started!

First things first, we need to [install the .NET Core 3 preview 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0).

Next we create an ASP.NET Core 3 web api:

1. Open your favorite terminal window (I'm using plain-old Command Prompt).
2. `cd` to a working directory
3. Run the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core 3 web api project named `webapi1`
  
    ```bash
    dotnet new webapi -o webapi1
    ```

That's it! We've just created a working project. To see it in action, run the following commands (but this is not required in order to progress):

```bash
cd webapi1
dotnet run
```
